	# inverse_of: :users ne marche pas avec through, polymorphic
	
	
	
There are a few limitations to inverse_of support:

    They do not work with :through associations.
    They do not work with :polymorphic associations.
    They do not work with :as associations.
    For belongs_to associations, has_many inverse associations are ignored.

Every association will attempt to automatically find the inverse association and set the :inverse_of option heuristically (based on the association name). Most associations with standard names will be supported. However, associations that contain the following options will not have their inverses set automatically:

    :conditions
    :through
    :polymorphic
    :foreign_key
